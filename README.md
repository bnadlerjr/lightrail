# Lightrail

Architecture experiments for RailwayIPC.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed by adding `lightrail` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lightrail, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/lightrail](https://hexdocs.pm/lightrail).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. A `precommit` helper script is available that will compile, test and lint code.
